<p>So what&#8217;s new today about PiTank?</p>
<p>I have cleaned up from dust, fixed some bugs in environment, set up VM for remote control and added new GPIO backend(<a href="https://github.com/bondar-pavel/rpi-tank/commit/129e4810c4cf5e12e2f1b09792a0f1011f2d5bdd">commit</a>) to rpi-tank repo. And now all pieces finally works: video streaming, webui for remote control, VM for port forwarding and controlling GPIO pins.</p>
<p>So basically you can drive PiTank remotely now, from any place on the globe. Just type in the browser http://stream.pitank.com:3000 and drive tank that is located in my kitchen.</p>
<p>On this page you can find video stream from tank camera and buttons to control it. Check out how it works in realtime by watching the video below:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Kmk956x0gfM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Most likely this page http://stream.pitank.com:3000 will not be available for you because, it just a debug version for now. But in future I plan to implement more production version the stream page, where multiple persons will be able to get timeslot to drive PiTank remotely.</p>
<p>Will keep you posted about the progress!</p>

<p>I wanted to try out Google Cloud for a long time and now I have a good reason to do it. My AWS 1 year trial period is over, I used it to run my site pitank.com. It used wordpress and one instance with 1 Gb usually was enough for a low volume site like this. But this solution is not scalable: database and apache are run on the same node, wp data is stored on the system disk volume.</p>
<p>When I started to look into Google Cloud I saw it was quite different from AWS. It is related to the pricing model and how instances are sold to you (Google gives you much better price if you take instance for a long period of time).</p>
<h2>Migrating WordPress from AWS to Google Cloud: Simple Way</h2>
<p>If you want to create new a single-node wordress installation you can easily do it in a few clicks using Pre-Built Software Packages. Here is a nice step-by-step instruction to deploy single-node wordpress:</p>
<p>http://www.wpexplorer.com/install-wordpress-google-cloud/</p>
<p>Even if you migrate from the existing wordpress you can export all data (posts, comments, images) from your current WP to a fresh one. To do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your $old_site/wp-admin/</li>
<li>Go to Tools-&gt;Export.</li>
<li>&#8220;Choose what to export&#8221; -&gt; All content</li>
<li>Press &#8220;Download Export File&#8221;</li>
<li>Then log in into you new wordpress installation $new_site/wp-admin/</li>
<li>Go to Tools-&gt;Import.</li>
<li>Choose WordPress.</li>
<li>Then press &#8220;Install Now&#8221; to install &#8220;WordPress Importer&#8221;</li>
<li>After that you will be able to import file with content you have previously downloaded from $old_sile</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this way you import all the content from your old site, but all the plugins and custom theme changes and settings are not imported. So you will have to spend some time to make your new installation to look and feel exactly the same as your old version.</p>
<h2>Is all-in-one WordPress installation really scalable?</h2>
<p>The issue with this way is that you get the same all-in-one installation. You can scale it only by making your instance bigger, For Compute Engine you can scale your instance from 1 vCPU and 0.6 Gb of RAM to 32 vCPU and 120GB of RAM. Well that is probably enough for 99% of WordPress blogs in terms of computing power. But it has following disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scaling up and down is possible only when the instance is stopped. It is typically manual operation and leads to downtime during the change. And it is really far from what you can call autoscalable.</li>
<li>Your instance is a single point of failure. Well it is not easy to get rid of a single point of failure while deploying your applications, but we can probably do several steps in that direction.</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t use any benefits of truly cloud applications with a current design. Cloud applications (Google Bucket Storage, Cloud SQL) are highly reliable and autoscalable by design,</li>
</ol>
<p>So I decided to migrate to Google Cloud infrastructure and tried to make my WordPress a bit more ready to become scalable.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to decompose static content from dynamic content and scale them separately.</p>
<h2>How to make WordPress more scalable?</h2>
<p>To achieve scalability you need to solve at least several problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>WordPress database should be decomposed from other web services (apache/php). So it should be scaled independently from other pieces, and there should be a single entry point to database.</li>
<li>Wp-content (all uploadable content) ideally have to be moved to the cloud storage.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cloud SQL</h2>
<p>To solve problem [1] Google has a Cloud SQL. Cloud SQL is a MySQL database that lives in Google&#8217;s cloud. It hugely simplifies SQL sever management, makes it reliable, secure and easily configurable. You don&#8217;t need to manage it over ssh, all DB related operations like import/export data, configuring regular backups and enabling binary logging (for point-in-time recovery and replication) can be done from Google Cloud Platform UI.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/qkqnNVk9jEU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The feature I like about Cloud SQL is &#8220;Enable automatic storage increase&#8221;.&#8221;Adds storage capacity whenever space is low. Up to 25 GB per increase. All increases are permanent. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/instance-settings?hl=en_US#automatic-storage-increase-2ndgen" target="_blank">Learn more</a>&#8220;. No need to extend your volume manually, login to the instance, run fdisk to resize the partition to make FS aware of the disk increase. No more Pain. Awesome!</p>
<p>To connect Cloud SQL with WordPress you need to use cloud_sql_proxy.</p>
<p>I followed <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql-connect-proxy">this official Google Guide</a> to set up and configure cloud_sql_proxy. Once you are done with that, you need to configure WordPress to use cloud_sql_proxy instead of local mysql. It is as simple as changing one line in your wp-config.php:</p>
<pre style="text-align: justify;"> define('DB_HOST', ':/cloudsql/$project:$region:$cloud_sql_name')</pre>
<p>Make sure to replace variables $project, $region, $cloud_sql_name with your project, region and cloud sql instance name. At this point connection between wordpress and cloud sql should work fine.</p>
<h2>Starting Cloud SQL Proxy at boot time</h2>
<p>To establish connection from the local machine to cloud sql you had to execute cloud_sql_proxy manually from the shell. Obviously, after reboot you will have to do it manually again. To automate connecting  cloud_sql_proxy to the cloud sql instance you can write a simple script. Debian/Ubunty images in Google Cloud use systemd as service manager, so let&#8217;s write systemd unit to do the job.</p>
<p>Create service file &#8220;/usr/lib/systemd/system/cloud_sql.service&#8221; with the following content:</p>
<pre>[Unit]
Description=Cloud SQL Proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/$path_to_cloud_proxy/cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql -instances=$project:$region:$cloud_sql_name
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</pre>
<p>It will be responsible for starting Cloud SQL Proxy and restarting it if dies. Just don&#8217;t forget to update path to the cloud_sql_proxy and parameters to reach cloud sql instance (project, region, instance-name).</p>
<p>Run the following commands to enable autostarting cloud_sql_proxy:</p>
<pre>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cloud_sql.service</pre>
<h2>WP-Stateless</h2>
<p>To solve the problem [2] you can use <a href="https://ru.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-stateless/installation/">wp-stateless</a> plugin for the WordPress. The WP-Stateless plugin copies your media uploads to Google Cloud Storage in real-time as you add items to your Media Library. The uploaded files are then served directly from the Google bucket, making your media files load quicker from the distributed Google servers. The plugin will handle all media uploads including image thumbnails, PDF documents, audio files, and more.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/aGntFnKwkE0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>What is great about WP-Stateless plugin is that you offload all your media to Google Cloud Storage, which is autoscalable by design and helps your site to work faster. Also it means you need smaller instance to serve your site, since part of the work is already served by Google Cloud Storage.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Cloud technologies like Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL helps to improve your site reliability, speed and simplicity of control/backup. This post just briefly describes what possibilities exist to use cloud power and in future post I plan to describe each option with more details.</p>

<p>My PiTank was collecting dust under the table for a while and today I got some free time to bring it back to life. There were some issues with connecting over ssh, so I connected it to my desktop monitor with hdmi cable and start debugging. When I got all services up and running cat&#8217;s attention was attracted by tank and I just started to record what happened.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-218 size-full" title="Cat tries to hit PiTank" src="https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/05/Cat_attack_tank_part2.jpg?resize=590%2C522&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cat_attack_tank_part2" width="590" height="522" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/05/Cat_attack_tank_part2.jpg?w=1150&amp;ssl=1 1150w, https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/05/Cat_attack_tank_part2.jpg?resize=128%2C113&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/05/Cat_attack_tank_part2.jpg?resize=254%2C225&amp;ssl=1 254w, https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/05/Cat_attack_tank_part2.jpg?resize=768%2C680&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/05/Cat_attack_tank_part2.jpg?resize=868%2C768&amp;ssl=1 868w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>By the way, since last videos PiTank was upgraded and you can see now bluetooth speaker on the back of PiTank. It is connected using 3.5&#8243; jack to Raspberry Pi analog output and can be used to reproduce different sounds or just play music. For now I just run &#8216;espeak&#8217; with some text, so it reads text from console.</p>
<p>Full video with my cat and PiTank is available on YouTube:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ugilfUDL7w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The end!</p>

<p>Finally! It has built-in Wi-Fi module, thanks to BCM43143 chip. So no more wi-fi dongles are needed. Also Pi 3 itself is 50% faster than Pi 2. And there benefits goes at the same cost as previous model.</p>
<p><strong>SPECS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SoC: Broadcom BCM2837 (roughly 50% faster than the Pi 2)</li>
<li>CPU: 1.2 GHZ quad-core ARM Cortex A53 (ARMv8 Instruction Set)</li>
<li>GPU: Broadcom VideoCore IV @ 400 MHz</li>
<li>Memory: 1 GB LPDDR2-900 SDRAM</li>
<li>USB ports: 4</li>
<li>Network: 10/100 MBPS Ethernet, 802.11n Wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.0</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. I already have 5 different Pi models at home and looks like I need more of them ! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pitank could have a lot of practical usages.  But live is strange thing, so I basically use it to stream cat videos&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-199 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/02/cat_stream.jpg?resize=590%2C589&#038;ssl=1" alt="cat_stream" width="590" height="589" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/02/cat_stream.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/02/cat_stream.jpg?resize=113%2C113&amp;ssl=1 113w, https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/wp-context/upload/2016/02/cat_stream.jpg?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>When cat is left alone at home and I am somewhere far away, I just login to my pitank and start watching what is happening.</p>
<p>Sometimes I stream it directly to youtube.  So here is one of the first such streaming sessions:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/unOWf7p8nAo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>By the way streaming to youtube from Raspberry pi is as simple as one line command:</p>
<blockquote><p>raspivid -o &#8211; -t 0 -fps 30 -b 6000000 | ffmpeg -re -ar 44100 -ac 2 -acodec pcm_s16le -f s16le -ac 2 -i /dev/zero -f h264 -i &#8211; -vcodec copy -acodec aac -ab 128k -g 50 -strict experimental -f flv rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/your-streaming-key</p></blockquote>
<p>raspivid sends video stream from picamera to sdtout, it is already encoded by h264. ffmpeg puts this video stream in flv container and sends to youtube. No video encoding/decoding  happens, so it works pretty good.  Also ffmpeg emulates sound track to make stream acceptable by youtube.</p>
<p>raspvid should be available in all recent distributions suitable for Raspberry Pi. And ffmpeg is not present on some distributions, so compiling from binaries might be required.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, so we started to test our flying devises: planes and quadrocopters. The very first take off was not so successful <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/4e0xcxhAFEo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>One quadrocopter flyed in stablized mode a few meters over the ground.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/5JHKMUTs0T8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>And the main event on the quarocopter party is flying to 500 meters. Once drone reach 300 meters nobody could even see it. So drone was controlled based on information received via radio channel. Altitude, location and battery level were main metrics to make a decidion what to do next.</p>
<p>Video captured on the ground:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/L7ihmkf5npk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>And second video uses one captured on the ground as a base and has mixed video stream from quarocopter.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/YEaDBcSqSCg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Next flight was up to 400 meters:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/9doVvOchw14?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>A long flight on a rc plane. Now I understand, flying rc plane is a good way to train your neck. You always have to move it left and right to see your plane.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kNlCO-7CqSg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>And one week before this quadrocopter party even more awesome video was recoreded. Alex&#8217;s drone reach 1200 meter altitude, reached the clouds and fell in 3 kilometers from launch point.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='590' height='332' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WA3gRmfEv9A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>

<p>Testdrived Raspberry Pi Tank with video streaming and controlling from web UI. In current setup PiTank uses webcam to capture video and encodes video stream by mjpg-streamer. Mjpg is natively supported by all known browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera). Tank remote control is also organized using web UI. So user is able to control tank and see streamed video on the same web page. Tank can be controlled using buttons in UI or by keyboard (&#8216;WASD&#8217;).</p>

<p><a href="https://bondar-pavel.github.io/pitank-site/raspberry-pi-tank-info/">PiTank</a> &#8211; is a Raspberry Pi based remotely controllable tank. It can be controlled from web browser using keyboard or mouse. Video from camera module mounted on top of PiTank is streamed directly into the browser. Technically PiTank can be remotely controlled from any point in the world where you have internet connection.</p>
